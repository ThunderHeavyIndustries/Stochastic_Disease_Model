 This is version of a my Stochastic Agent model of STI infection in discrete populations.
 This is a rewrite from some C++ code I wrote. I'm rewriting it in Crystal to familiarize myself
 with the language, as well as to revisit this code, and enjoy rewriting it in a more "ruby" way.
 Since Ruby is my preffered language.
